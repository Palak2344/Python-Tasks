# Python Tasks

## Overview
This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic programming concepts, including user input, mathematical operations, and string manipulation. Each script is designed to perform specific tasks and provide a user-friendly experience.

## Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
This program performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers provided by the user. The operations included are:

- **Addition:** Computes the sum of the two numbers.
- **Subtraction:** Calculates the difference between the first and second numbers.
- **Multiplication:** Multiplies the two numbers together.
- **Division:** Divides the first number by the second number, with a check to prevent division by zero.

### How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
2. The program reads these inputs and converts them to floating-point numbers to allow for decimal calculations.
3. It performs the four basic operations and stores the results.
4. Finally, it displays the results of each operation on the screen, including a message indicating if division by zero was attempted.


## Task 2: Personalized Greeting
This program creates a personalized greeting message based on the user's input. It takes both the first name and last name and combines them to form a full name.

### How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter their first name and last name.
2. The program concatenates the first name and last name into a single string representing the full name.
3. It then prints a personalized greeting message that includes the full name.
